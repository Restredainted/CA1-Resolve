 ==== Resolve Read Me ====

---- Introduction ---- 
For this game I wanted to create a game with a strong combat system, 
influenced strongly by many 'Metroidvania' games such as 
Castlevania itself, Hollow Knight, shovel Knight, etc. 

This style of game provides a number of challenges, 
from creating fluid movement and satisfying combat actions to easy to read UI/UX legible at a moments notice. 



---- Health System. ----
The health system is a straight forward max health system, 
the player can take up to their max health in damage before dying resulting in a restart or gameover.
the player can collect health upgrade items increasing their maximum health, or generic healing items to
restore lost health.

---- Mana System ----
The mana system is a similar simple system, but they're limited only to their currently available Mana cells,
which when spent recharge over time. the player may also pick up additional mana cells to increase their maximum allowance. 

for this prototype I will only be including a single fireball spell, which can be charged up by holding down the action key,
and released for higher damage at a higher mana cost. 

---- Combat System ---- 
Again, in effect to the previous sytems, the combat system is a simplified hack and slash style, the player can attack with their
weapon or cast spells using the mana system, chipping away at enemies health pools until they expire. 

---- Movement System ----
For the movement system I Wanted to keep the availabel options simple, from simple left and right movement, with a single jump
which the player must utilize effectively to defeat their enemies and platform their way through the level. 
If I have time I may add a dodge/dash ability. 
I am intentionally not adding a lot of movement as to not overbear the player with too many buttons.
